# Data Science Tutor - AI Chatbot

This project is a **Data Science AI Tutor** built using **Streamlit**, **Google Generative AI**, and **Langchain**. The application allows users to interact with an AI tutor that answers questions related to data science, such as machine learning, data visualization, AI algorithms, and more.

## Features

- **Login**: Users can log in by providing a username, and their chat history is saved for future sessions.
- **Chat History**: The application saves and retrieves the chat history specific to each user.
- **Data Science Focus**: The AI tutor is specialized to provide help on topics related to **Data Science**, such as machine learning, data visualization, AI algorithms, and more.
- **Download Chat History**: Users can download their entire chat history in a text file for reference.
- **Delete Chat History**: Users can delete their chat history at any time.
- **AI Responses**: The AI will only answer questions strictly related to data science. If the question is not related, it will politely ask the user to ask a data science-related question.

## Requirements

### Python Packages

The following Python libraries are required to run the application:

- `streamlit`: Web framework for creating the user interface.
- `google-generativeai`: Google Generative AI API for AI-based responses.
- `langchain`: Langchain to help manage chains of AI interactions.
- `dotenv`: To manage environment variables such as the Google API key.
- `os`: To interact with the file system.

You can install the required libraries by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt```

### Google API Key Setup

To use the Google Generative AI service, you need to set up a **Google API key**. Follow these steps:

1. **Create a project** on the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. **Enable the Google Generative AI API** for your project.
3. **Create API credentials** and obtain your **API key**.
4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your API key like this:

```plaintext
google_token=YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE```

## Usage

### Starting the Application

1. Ensure that you have your environment set up, including the API key as mentioned above.
2. To run the Streamlit app, use the following command:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

This will start the Streamlit app, and you can access the application in your browser.

### User Flow

1. **Login**: Enter your username to start a new session. The application will load your previous chat history if available.
2. **Chat**: Ask questions related to data science in the chatbox. The AI will respond accordingly. Only data science-related questions will be answered.
3. **Manage Chat History**:
    * **Delete**: If you want to clear your chat history, click on the "Delete Chat History" button.
    * **Download**: You can download your chat history as a `.txt` file by clicking the "Download Chat History" button.

### Chat History Storage

The application stores each user's chat history in a JSON file inside the `chat_history/` directory. The chat history is saved whenever a user interacts with the AI. Each entry in the history includes both the user's input and the AI's response.

If no previous chat history exists for a user, a new session is started, and the history is initialized as empty.

## Project Structure

```bash

├── app.py                # Main Streamlit app
├── .env                  # Environment file to store API key
├── chat_history/         # Directory where chat history JSON files are stored
├── requirements.txt      # Python dependencies
└── README.md             # This file
```

## Future Enhancements

- **User Authentication**: Implement more robust user authentication and session management.
- **Advanced AI Capabilities**: Integrate additional advanced data science tools for richer responses.
- **Data Science Resources**: Provide additional resources, such as tutorials or recommended readings, directly in the chat.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter an error with the API key, make sure the `.env` file contains the correct API key, and the key is properly loaded using `dotenv`.
- If there are issues with chat history, ensure that the `chat_history/` directory exists and is accessible for reading and writing files.
