It assumes a linear relationship, meaning the change in the dependent variable is proportional to the change in the independent variables.  The goal is to find the best-fitting straight line (or hyperplane in multiple linear regression) that minimizes the difference between the predicted values and the actual values of the dependent variable.  This is often done using the method of least squares."
